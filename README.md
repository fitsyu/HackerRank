For every challenge, after understanding it, devise a plan in our powerful mind to solve it.

Write unit tests for every use case.

Fail fast and quickly learn from mistakes.

Keep doing it till we get it right.

Don't be shy to get hints from others when we couldn't figure it out.

That is how we do and will always do.

Good luck!
